h1 Kosmonaut
h2 Kontent Management System

p Kosmonaut is a very lightweight Content Management System that allows you to easily add pages. The intention is for it to have easily added modules that add functionality as and when you need it.

p Kosmonaut was the brainchild of Tom Oakley at the Summitt Awesome Hackathon.

p It is named after the bar in Manchester where we had a break for food, beer and table tennis.
