Kosmonaut
==============
Kontent Management System
--------------------------------

Kosmonaut is a very lightweight Content Management System that allows you to easily add pages. It supports nested pages, tags, versioning and markdown. The intention is for it to have modules that add functionality as and when you need it.

It is written in Sinatra and uses MongoDB to store the pages.

Kosmonaut was the brainchild of Tom Oakley at the [Summitt Awesome Hackathon](http://summitawesome.co.uk/).

It is named after the [bar in Manchester](http://www.kosmonaut.co/) where we had a break for food, beer and table tennis.
